# Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Fix Applied

The **404 error** has been resolved! Here's what was changed:

### Problem
- Netlify was trying to serve a Python FastAPI application as static files
- No `index.html` was available in the root directory
- Missing proper Netlify configuration

### Solution
✅ **Created static build system:**
- Added `netlify.toml` configuration file
- Created `scripts/build_static.py` to convert FastAPI templates to static HTML
- Generated static files in `dist/` folder
- Added proper redirects for SPA routing

### Files Created/Modified
1. **netlify.toml** - Netlify configuration
2. **scripts/build_static.py** - Static build script  
3. **dist/** - Static build output folder
4. **dist/_redirects** - Netlify routing rules

## 🔄 Deployment Steps

1. **Push the latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Netlify static build configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Netlify will automatically:**
   - Run `python3 scripts/build_static.py` (build command)
   - Deploy the `dist/` folder (publish directory)
   - Apply redirects for proper routing

## 🌐 Expected Result

After deployment, https://cardiology-ai-agent.netlify.app/ will show:
- ✅ Landing page with system overview
- ✅ Navigation to different interfaces (Hospital, Patient, Doctor, Emergency)
- ✅ Static demo functionality
- ✅ Information about the full system capabilities

## 📝 Notes

- **Static Demo**: The deployed version is a static demo showing the UI
- **Full Functionality**: For complete AI agent functionality, the Python backend needs to run locally with API keys
- **GitHub Repository**: Users can clone the repo for the complete system

## 🔧 If Issues Persist

1. Check Netlify build logs in your dashboard
2. Ensure the build command succeeded
3. Verify files exist in the `dist/` folder
4. Check that `index.html` is present in the publish directory

The site should now load properly! 🎉
