- Project architecture documentation

## 🚀 How to Launch the Application

### 1. Set Your OpenAI API Key
Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your actual OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

### 2. Run the Application
Choose one of these methods:

**Option A: Using Python directly**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Option B: Using the VS Code task**
- Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
- Type "Tasks: Run Task"
- Select "Run Cardiology AI Development Server"

**Option C: Using the debugger**
- Press `F5` or go to Run > Start Debugging
- Select "Debug FastAPI with Uvicorn"

### 3. Access the Application
- API Server: http://localhost:8000
- Interactive API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Alternative API Docs: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## 🔧 Available API Endpoints

- `POST /chat` - Main chat interface for patient interactions
- `POST /triage` - Dedicated triage assessment endpoint
- `POST /appointment` - Appointment booking endpoint
- `GET /patient/{patient_id}` - Retrieve patient information
- `GET /patient/{patient_id}/appointments` - Get patient appointments
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## 🧪 Testing the Setup

Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
python test_setup.py
```

## 📚 Example Usage

Once running, you can test the API with curl:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Triage assessment
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/triage" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "patient_id": "P001",
       "message": "I have chest pain",
       "conversation_context": {}
     }'

# Appointment booking
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/appointment" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "patient_id": "P001",
       "message": "I need to schedule a follow-up",
       "conversation_context": {}
     }'
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

- **Format code**: `black .`
- **Lint code**: `flake8 .`
- **Run tests**: `pytest`
- **Start development server**: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **API Key Required**: You must set a valid OpenAI API key to use the AI features
2. **Demo Data**: Sample patient data is included for testing
3. **Security**: This is a demonstration system - implement proper authentication for production
4. **Medical Disclaimer**: This system is for educational purposes only

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Set your OpenAI API key in `.env`
2. Run `python main.py`
3. Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to explore the API
4. Start building your cardiology AI applications!

The system is ready for development and testing. Happy coding! 🏥✨
